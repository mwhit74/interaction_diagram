A similar problem to find the PM interaction diagram is finding the stress and
strain profile on a cross-section given a P-M demand value. This is useful in
determining whether or not the section has failed, the speific stresses in the
different layers or individual pieces of steel, and the stress and strain in the
concrete.

This can be accomplished by selecting a value of c and phi then calculating the
corresponding P-M values. Checking to see if it is correct then changing the
values of c and phi to move towards a solution. I think selection of the new c
and phi is a bit more involved to get the program to iterate to a solution but
it is not overly complicated. 

I wanted to record my thought here before moving back to another project. Since
this is related I wanted to incorporate it here for now. I think eventually this
will be its own package or at least its own module in a concrete analysis
package. This is yet to be determined.
